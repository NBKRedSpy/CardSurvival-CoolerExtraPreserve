# Cooler Extra Preserve

Adds extra cooling (.25) to a clay cooler to match the cellar bonus.

The reasoning is that maximizing food life requires move all food to the cellar in clay coolers.  

It is quite a bit of unnecessary real time delay to move between the cellar and the main hut over and over when cooking.

# Requirements
Requires the Mod Loader found here:

https://www.nexusmods.com/cardsurvivaltropicalisland/mods/23

# Cellar Stasis
Note that with this mod, any coolers placed in a cellar will never spoil.

# Game Balance

To keep the mod from being over powered, my recommendation would be to only add this mod after a cellar is created.
Then make sure to not use a cooler pot in the cellar.

# Request for Help
This mod is a workaround.  I wanted to create a new cooler with extra preservation instead, but for some reason the mod was not working as expected.  If anyone could give some tips, I would appreciate it.  The fill rates were wrong and it was not losing the preservation bonus when changing back to an "Off" cooler.
